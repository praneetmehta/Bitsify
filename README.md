Node.js based mp3 streaming service

Can serve files in your music directory anywhere on your pc, over lan!!

just clone the repo, 
run npm install and finally
create a folder named symlink in the public directory.

Now open routes/index.js and on line 3 modify testFolder variable to your music directory's absoulte path. That's it.
all done!!

run node app in the root directory of the app and open localhost:3000  (3000 is the default port used, you may change it if you want)on your browser.
and Stream songs ;)

The application is quiet responsive as i have used flexboxes everywhere.

mail me at praneet.mehta@gmail.com for any issues.
